\[(.*?)\]

 Explanation:
 •\[ : [ is a meta char and needs to be escaped if you want to match it literally.
 •(.*?) : match everything in a non-greedy way and capture it.
 •\] : ] is a meta char and needs to be escaped if you want to match it literally.
 
The other answer's method, using [^]] is faster than non-greedy (?), and also works with regex flavours that don't support non-greedy. However, non-greedy looks nicer 


// using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
// pattern = any number of arbitrary characters between square brackets.
var pattern = @"\[(.*?)\]";
var query = "H1-receptor antagonist [HSA:3269] [PATH:hsa04080(3269)]";
var matches = Regex.Matches(query, pattern);

foreach (Match m in matches) {
    Console.WriteLine(m.Groups[1]);
}
